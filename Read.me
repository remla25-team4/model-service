---

## Run with Docker

### 1. Build the image

```bash
docker build -t model-service .
```

### 2. Run the container

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080   -e MODEL_URL=https://your-host.com/path/to/model.pkl   model-service
```

> Currently `MODEL_URL` does not really work. We use the default model from the repo.
